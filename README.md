# 🌊 Tempura — A Webtoon Alternative on the Stellar Network

Tempura is a decentralized **Webtoon platform** built on the **Stellar Network**, empowering creators with **fair monetization** and transparent ownership through blockchain technology.

## 🚀 Overview

Current Webtoon platforms centralize revenue and restrict creative ownership.  
**Tempura** solves this by using **Stellar smart contracts** to enable:
- Direct, transparent payments to artists and writers
- NFT-based ownership for each episode or comic
- Open participation in publishing, reading, and supporting creators

> **Built for the [Scaffold Stellar Hackathon](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/scaffoldstellar/detail)**

## ✨ Key Features

- **Reader Access** — Discover, read, and collect your favorite series securely
- **Ownership Proof** — Every published comic episode is stored and owned on-chain

- **Next.js + Tailwind** frontend for smooth performance and minimal latency
